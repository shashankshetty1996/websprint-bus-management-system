# Websprint Bus Management System
- - - -
## Introduction
Final round of websprint was basically where we had to design a website without using internet. Frameworks where provided in advance where we had to design both frontend and backend as well.

## Technology used
Front end uses Bootstrap 4 and Angularjs where as backend i used Node JS and MySQL database for auth i used jasonwebtoken.

## Future Work/ Issue
I ran with some issues in the angular auth service so both frontend and backend functions together failed to work in this application. I would loved if someone wants to fix this issue and push it back to my repository.
